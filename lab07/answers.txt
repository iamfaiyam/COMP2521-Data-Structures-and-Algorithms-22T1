Time Complexity analysis of lab07.
Name: Faiyam Islam

NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(V + E) i.e. O(n) since number of cells is always bigger than 
number of edges and number of vertices due to walls.


- Explanation: 
(1) The program goes through edges meaning the time complexity is E (the number of edges). 
(2) As the BFS algorithm is recursively called which is E - 1 as the while loop iterates. 
(3) When initialising the matrices this takes V time hence the total time complexity becomes O(V + E). 

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(V + E) i.e. O(n) since number of cells is always bigger than 
number of edges and number of vertices due to walls.

- Explanation: 
(1) As Q is not empty, it goes through the edges every time once thus making time complexity
E, which is the number of edge.s 
(2) Similar to solveBfs, intialising the matrices takes V time therefore time complexity becomes O(V + E).
